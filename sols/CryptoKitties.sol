/**
买卖和繁殖服务（出台） 合约

在这里，我们有公开的方法来拍卖猫或招标猫或繁殖猫。 实际的拍卖功能是在两个兄弟合约
（一个用于买卖，一个用于繁殖）中处理的，而拍卖的创建和投标主要是通过核心合约


根据开发者的说法，他们将这个拍卖功能分为“兄弟”合约，是因为“他们的逻辑有点复杂，
总是存在微妙的bug风险。 通过保留它们自己的合约，我们可以升级它们而不会中断追踪小猫所有权的主合约



拍卖合约包括买、卖以及繁殖，繁殖指的是提供一方作为父亲，拿取繁殖费用并由母方获取繁殖的新喵。
根据开发者所描述的，他们将拍卖合约分成几个子合约，因为“其中逻辑比较复杂，总是存在bug的风险，
将每个过程分成单独的一个合约，我们就可以在不改变主合约的情况下升级子合约。”
因此这个合约提供了两个函数setSaleAuctionAddress()和setSiringAuctionAddress用来设置子合约的地址，
以便更方便的升级子合约。从安全性来讲这的确有利于代码的修复与升级，但是从另外一个角度来讲，
合约中的CEO就有了任意更改拍卖规则的权利

/// @title CryptoKitties: Collectible, breedable, and oh-so-adorable cats on the Ethereum blockchain.
/// @author Axiom Zen (https://www.axiomzen.co)
/// @dev The main CryptoKitties contract, keeps track of kittens so they don't wander around and get lost.
contract KittyCore is KittyMinting {

    // This is the main CryptoKitties contract. In order to keep our code seperated into logical sections,
    // we've broken it up in two ways. First, we have several seperately-instantiated sibling contracts
    // that handle auctions and our super-top-secret genetic combination algorithm. The auctions are
    // seperate since their logic is somewhat complex and there's always a risk of subtle bugs. By keeping
    // them in their own contracts, we can upgrade them without disrupting the main contract that tracks
    // kitty ownership. The genetic combination algorithm is kept seperate so we can open-source all of
    // the rest of our code without making it _too_ easy for folks to figure out how the genetics work.
    // Don't worry, I'm sure someone will reverse engineer it soon enough!
    //
    // Secondly, we break the core contract into multiple files using inheritence, one for each major
    // facet of functionality of CK. This allows us to keep related code bundled together while still
    // avoiding a single giant file with everything in it. The breakdown is as follows:
    //
    //      - KittyBase: This is where we define the most fundamental code shared throughout the core
    //             functionality. This includes our main data storage, constants and data types, plus
    //             internal functions for managing these items.
    //
    //      - KittyAccessControl: This contract manages the various addresses and constraints for operations
    //             that can be executed only by specific roles. Namely CEO, CFO and COO.
    //
    //      - KittyOwnership: This provides the methods required for basic non-fungible token
    //             transactions, following the draft ERC-721 spec (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/721).
    //
    //      - KittyBreeding: This file contains the methods necessary to breed cats together, including
    //             keeping track of siring offers, and relies on an external genetic combination contract.
    //
    //      - KittyAuctions: Here we have the public methods for auctioning or bidding on cats or siring
    //             services. The actual auction functionality is handled in two sibling contracts (one
    //             for sales and one for siring), while auction creation and bidding is mostly mediated
    //             through this facet of the core contract.
    //
    //      - KittyMinting: This final facet contains the functionality we use for creating new gen0 cats.
    //             We can make up to 5000 "promo" cats that can be given away (especially important when
    //             the community is new), and all others can only be created and then immediately put up
    //             for auction via an algorithmically determined starting price. Regardless of how they
    //             are created, there is a hard limit of 50k gen0 cats. After that, it's all up to the
    //             community to breed, breed, breed!
